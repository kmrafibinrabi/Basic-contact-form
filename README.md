3. Include the following HTML code in your page:

```html
<form action="contact-form.php" method="post">
  <label for="name">Name</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

  <label for="subject">Subject</label>
  <input type="text" id="subject" name="subject" required>

  <label for="message">Message</label>
  <textarea id="message" name="message" required></textarea>

  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

4. Save the HTML page and upload it to your server.

5. Ensure that your server has PHP installed and configured to send emails.

## Customization

You can customize the contact form by modifying the HTML and CSS code. Feel free to add or remove fields, change the styling, or enhance the form's functionality according to your needs.

To customize the email address where the form submissions are sent, open the `contact-form.php` file and locate the following line:

```php
$to = "your-email@example.com";
```

Replace `your-email@example.com` with your desired email address.

## Form Validation
